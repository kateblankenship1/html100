    <h1>HTML Semantics</h1>
      <h3>How do you tell the difference between semantic and non-semantic elements?</h3>
      <article><p><strong>Semantic Elements</strong> are tags that clearly indicate what type of content
        they possess. </p>
      <p><strong>Non-Semantic Elements</strong>  are broad-spectrum tags that are somewhat harder to organize and read through.
        They don't give any details about what kind of content they possess.</p>
        <p>The concept of HTML semantics was developed in response to Google's analyzation
          of 1 billion different web pages to document how divs and other elements were being written. The use of semantics
          is part of the mission of HTML5 to organize the chaos that is the world of web design. Semantic tags are essential
          to make code more readable by coders and assisting programs alike. They are particularly useful when it comes
          to other coders and programmers reading someone's code, as they help format and break down the content of the
          code. It's easier to look for the element containing and article when it's actually called <em> "article" </em> instead
          of just <em>"div" </em>.
